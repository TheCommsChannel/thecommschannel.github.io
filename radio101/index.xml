      <description>Receivers This post will be covering the different types of receiver options available out there that you may run into. We&amp;rsquo;ve used all of these different types of radios over the years and We&amp;rsquo;ll cover their uses and pros and cons of each one. The next post will cover radio you can transmit on, known as transceivers.
Terms used Before we get into it, there are some terms that you may be unfamiliar with if youâ€™re completely new to radio that I want to quickly cover before we continue.</description>
